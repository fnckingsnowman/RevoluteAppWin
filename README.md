this repo includes the code for a frontend electron based application used to configure the revolute scrollwheel and https://github.com/tongtongwang86/Revolute is the repo for that. 
this app is expected to be compatibale with both the wired version and the wireless version of the revolute
but until the full bluetooth thing is done developing by tongtongwang86, i will be refining the GUI and the software stuff for the wired version
